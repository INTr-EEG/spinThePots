## Spin the Pots (Hughes and Ensor, 2005)

```
The Spin the Pots task was developed to assess working memory and inhibition 
in young children. The child was shown eight distinct "pots" which are set up 
on a Lazy Susan tray, and then invited to help the researcher place attractive 
stickers in six of the eight pots. The tray was then covered with a cloth and 
spun. Following this, the cloth was removed and the child choose a pot with 
the aim of finding all six stickers without error. Each choice was recorded 
and the child congratulated/encouraged before moving on to the next trial. 
Fixed spatial cues could not be used due to the rotation of the cups. Children 
were allowed a maximum of 16 trials and the task ended when all six stickers 
had been found. The task was scored as 16 minus the number of errors.
